# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Using-GAN-based-ML
This project uses GANs and supervised machine learning to predict used car prices accurately. By generating synthetic data with GANs, the model improves performance and handles rare listings better. The process involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
